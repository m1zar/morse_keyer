# morse_keyer
Text to keypresses in morse, works for online morse chat pages.

Frustrated with learning morse so decided to write something to send messages without error.
Can be easily modified to use any particular key or indeed the mouse clicks.

Dependencies are:

python 3.x & 
pyautogui

Pyautogui can be installed with 'pip install pyautogui' once python is installed.

Just thought I'd share.
